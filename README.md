## 🎯 Project Overview

This analysis seeks to answer several key questions about what makes a film successful, both critically and commercially.

*   **Dataset:** A cleaned dataset of the IMDb Top 1000 films, including title, director, year, genre, IMDb rating, Metascore, and box office gross.
*   **Data Source:** The original dataset and initial exploration can be found on Kaggle: [IMDb Top 1000 Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shirahazel/imdb-top-1000-movies).

### ❓ Key Questions
- How do genre and director influence a film’s critical and audience reception?
- What are the trends in film ratings, critical scores, and box office gross over the decades?
- What is the relationship between critical/audience reception and box office performance?
- Are there notable exceptions and outliers to these trends?

## 💡 Summary of Findings

-   ✨ **Genre & Director Influence:** Certain genres (e.g., Western, Mystery, Film-Noir) and renowned directors (e.g., Coppola, Nolan, Jackson) are consistently associated with higher audience ratings and critical scores.

-   📈 **Trends Over Time:** While box office gross has steadily increased over the decades (largely due to inflation and market growth), audience and critical ratings have remained remarkably stable.

-   🤔 **Ratings vs. Revenue:** There is only a weak correlation between high audience/critical scores and box office revenue. Many commercially successful films received lukewarm reviews, while some of the most critically acclaimed films were not high earners.

-   🎬 **Notable Outliers:** Several films defy the general trends. These outliers, including low-rated blockbusters and low-grossing masterpieces, were identified and are summarized in the analysis notebook.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Python 3.x**
-   **Jupyter Notebook**
-   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
